Traffic Light Controller is a VHDL project simulating a real life traffic controller and has various components to ensure it's proper functionality.

The heart of the system is a Finite State Machine (FSM) that
directs the unit to light the main and side street lights at
appropriate times for the specified time intervals. This unit
depends on several inputs which are generated outside the
system.
